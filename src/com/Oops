Encapsulation (data hiding) : in Java or object oriented programming language is a concept which
 enforces protecting variables, functions from outside of class.
 
Polymorphism : is an Oops concept which advice use of common interface instead of concrete 
implementation while writing code. In Java programming whole concept of interface is based 
on Polymorphism.

Abstraction : in Java or Object oriented programming is a way to segregate implementation 
from an interface. Abstraction in Java is achieved by  using interface and abstract class in Java.
Abstraction is creating interface to denote common behavior without specifying any details about
how that behavior works e.g. You create an interface called Server which has the start() and stop()
method. This is called abstraction of Server because every server should have a way to start and stop 
and details may differ.
