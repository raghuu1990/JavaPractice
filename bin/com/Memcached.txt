Confirming Memcached Installation

To check if Memcached is presently running or not, run the command given below −

$ps aux | grep memcached

This command should show that Memcached is running on the default port 11211.

To run Memcached server on a different port, run the command given below −

$memcached -p 11111 -U 11111 -u user -d

It should start the server and listen on TCP port 11111 and UDP port 11111 as a daemon process.

This command is explained below −

    -p is for TCP port number
    -U is for UDP port number
    -u is for user name
    -d runs memcached as daemon process

You can run multiple instances of Memcached server through a single installation.
